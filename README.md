# Rake App

This is a simple Ruby project containing a basic setup to create and run custom Rake tasks.

### Installation

Run `bundle` to install gem dependencies.

### Run

To display available Rake tasks, just run `rake -T`.
To add some new ones, add it to `./lib/tasks` folder (there is already one `hello.rake`).
